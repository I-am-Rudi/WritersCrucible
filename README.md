This extension lives in your status bar, providing at-a-glance feedback on your progress without interrupting your workflow.

## Main Features

* **Instantaneous Input Detection:** The extension automatically
  detects instantaneous character input, Auto Complete, Copilot suggestions and
  pastes. They are counted up to a specified number character, ensuring that
  your typed characters count higher towards your daily goal. You can configure
  the maximum number of characters tracked per input operation (default: 50)
  set to zero to exclude instantaneous input from your daily goal.
* **Reset Today's Count:** Added a command to reset only the current day's progress to zero, perfect for fixing copy-paste errors without affecting your history.
* **Graphical Statistics:** A new command opens a dedicated panel to visualize your writing progress with beautiful charts, showing daily output and cumulative growth over time.
* **Per-Project Tracking:** The extension automatically tracks your progress separately for each project folder (workspace).
* **Configurable File Types:** You can tell the extension exactly which file types to track via your VS Code settings.

## The Writer's Crucible Philosophy

This extension is built on a specific methodology designed for the realities of non-fiction writing.

### Why Characters, Not Words?

While word count is a common metric, character count offers several advantages for non-fiction authors, researchers, and technical writers:

1.  **Precision:** There's no ambiguity. "Socio-economic" is one word, but it's 15 characters of effort. "A" and "the" are words, but they represent minimal progress. Characters measure the literal volume of text you produce.
2.  **Values All Work:** Non-fiction writing isn't just prose. It involves lists, data, citations, code snippets, and structured notes. A character count values all of these tangible contributions to your final manuscript.
3.  **Encourages Conciseness:** Thinking in characters can subtly encourage more deliberate and concise language, a hallmark of strong non-fiction.

### Choosing Your Challenge

Each challenge level is designed for a specific workload and goal. Find the one that matches your current situation.

#### 1. The Micro-Sprint (500 Chars/Day)

* **Workload:** A few minutes of focused effort. Equivalent to writing 1-2 solid paragraphs or a few detailed bullet points.
* **Best For:**
    * Writers overcoming a block or building a new habit.
    * Extremely busy individuals who can only spare 15-20 minutes.
    * The "zero day" killerâ€”a low bar to ensure you write *something* every day.
* **Expected Monthly Output:** ~15,000 characters (~2,500 words). Enough for a solid blog post or the initial draft of a short article.

#### 2. The Standard Kilo-Challenge (1,000 Chars/Day)

* **Workload:** A manageable daily session of 20-40 minutes. Equivalent to writing 3-4 paragraphs.
* **Best For:**
    * The average writer looking to make consistent, steady progress on a long-term project.
    * Balancing a day job with a writing project (e.g., a book or thesis).
* **Expected Monthly Output:** ~30,000 characters (~4,500-5,000 words). The length of a substantial book chapter, a feature article, or a detailed report section. This is the sweet spot for sustainable output.

#### 3. The Marathoner's Pace (2,000 Chars/Day)

* **Workload:** A significant, dedicated writing session of about an hour.
* **Best For:**
    * Writers who are on a deadline.
    * Academics in a dedicated "writing phase" for a paper.
    * Full-time writers or those with a clear, protected block of writing time each day.
* **Expected Monthly Output:** ~60,000 characters (~9,000-10,000 words). Enough to make serious headway on a manuscript or complete a major paper.

#### 4. The 3K Crucible (3,000 Chars/Day)

* **Workload:** A heavy-duty, professional-grade session of 1.5-2+ hours. This level also values non-prose work like revision and citation.
* **Best For:**
    * Authors in the final push to finish a book draft.
    * PhD candidates writing their dissertation against a deadline.
    * Anyone whose primary job for a set period is to produce a large volume of text.
* **Expected Monthly Output:** ~90,000+ characters (~13,500+ words). This is professional-level output that can produce a significant portion of a manuscript in a short time.

#### non-fiction specific
##### `writers-crucible.addRevisionTime`

* **What it does:** When you run this command, it instantly adds **1,000 characters** to your daily goal.
* **Why it exists:** Heavy revision and deep editing are mentally taxing and crucial for a high-quality manuscript. You might spend 45 minutes intensely rewriting a single paragraph, resulting in a *net loss* of characters but a massive *gain* in quality. This command provides a way to get "credit" for that focused editing work, ensuring you can still meet your daily goal even on days dedicated to revision rather than drafting.

##### `writers-crucible.addCitation`

* **What it does:** This command adds **50 characters** to your daily goal each time you run it.
* **Why it exists:** Creating and formatting citations, references, and bibliographies is a time-consuming but necessary part of non-fiction and academic writing. This work produces very few characters relative to the effort involved. This command allows you to acknowledge the effort of accurately citing a source, ensuring that this critical but low-character task contributes to your daily progress.

## Features

* **Status Bar Progress:** Your daily character count and goal are always visible.
* **Multiple Challenge Levels:** Choose the challenge that fits your schedule and goals.

  - Manual typing
  - Copy/paste operations (ignored to prevent cheating)
  - GitHub Copilot completions (both inline and dropdown)
  - All other text insertions
* **Intelligent Input Detection:** Distinguishes between different types of text input and applies appropriate tracking rules.
* **Daily Reset:** Your progress automatically resets to zero each day, and the previous day's work is saved to your project's history.

## How to Use

1.  **(First Time) Configure Settings (Optional):**
    * Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Settings > Settings` on Mac).
    * Search for "Writer's Crucible".
    * **Tracked File Types:** Add the language IDs you want to track (e.g., `latex`, `restructuredtext`). The defaults are `markdown` and `plaintext`.
    * **Max Tracked Characters:** Set the maximum characters tracked per input operation (default: 50). This prevents large paste operations from inflating your count while allowing most Copilot completions to be tracked.
    * **Undo Grace Period:** Adjust how long deletions can "undo" recent character additions (default: 30 seconds).

2.  **Start a Challenge:**
    * Open a project folder.
    * Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `Writer's Crucible: Start or Change Writing Challenge`.
    * Select your desired challenge from the list. This challenge will be set *only for the current project*.

3.  **Write!**
    * Open a file of a tracked type.
    * As you type, use Copilot completions, or write manually, you will see your character count increase in the status bar.

4.  **View Statistics:**
    * **For Visual Charts:** Run `Writer's Crucible: Visualize Project Statistics` from the Command Palette. A new tab will open with charts of your progress.
    * **For Text Stats:** Click the **Writer's Crucible** item in the status bar or run `Writer's Crucible: Show Project Statistics (Text)`.

5.  **Reset Your Data:**
    * To reset all data *for the current project only*, run `Writer's Crucible: Reset Project Challenge Data` from the Command Palette.
